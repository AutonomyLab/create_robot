  Originally the packages were named as 'create_autonomy', with the 'ca\_' suffix for short.
  This was due to a name conflict with the turtlebot packages (e.g. create_driver and create_description):
  https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_create.git
  Since the turtlebot packages are not released into ROS Melodic, the plan is to release these packages instead.
  If the turtlebot packages are eventually released, it should be straightforward to adapt them to use the
  description and driver packages here.
  Summary of renaming:
  * create_autonomy -> create_robot
  * ca_description -> create_description
  * ca_driver -> create_driver
  * ca_msgs -> create_msgs
  * ca_tools -> create_bringup
